#### **1. Introduction**  
**Key Problem**: Traditional multi-fidelity models (e.g., Kennedy & O'Hagan's linear autoregressive scheme) struggle to capture **nonlinear** or **space-dependent cross-correlations** between low- and high-fidelity data. Low-fidelity models may provide erroneous trends outside their validity regime, limiting their utility.  
**Solution**: Introduce a **nonlinear autoregressive Gaussian process (NARGP)** framework that generalizes linear autoregressive models by learning complex cross-correlations through deep GP-inspired structures.  

**Core Idea**: Replace the linear scaling factor \(\rho\) in Kennedy & O'Hagan’s model with a **nonlinear mapping** \(z_{t-1}(f_{t-1}(x))\), modeled as a Gaussian process. This allows the algorithm to capture nonlinear dependencies while maintaining computational tractability.

#### **2. Methods**  
**Model Structure**:  
1. **Recursive GP Framework**:  
   - For fidelity levels \(t=1,\ldots,s\), model outputs as:  
     \[
     f_t(x) = g_t\left(x, f_{t-1}(x)\right) + \delta_t(x),
     \]  
     where \(g_t\) is a GP mapping inputs \(x\) and lower-fidelity outputs \(f_{t-1}(x)\) to higher-fidelity outputs.  
   - **Kernel Design**: Use a composite kernel to decompose contributions from input space and lower-fidelity outputs:  
     \[
     k_{t_g} = k_{t_\rho}(x, x') \cdot k_{t_f}(f_{t-1}(x), f_{t-1}(x')) + k_{t_\delta}(x, x'),
     \]  
     where \(k_{t_\rho}\), \(k_{t_f}\), \(k_{t_\delta}\) are squared-exponential kernels with ARD weights.  

2. **Training Workflow**:  
   - **Step 1**: Train a standard GP on the lowest-fidelity data.  
   - **Step 2**: Sequentially train GPs at higher fidelity levels using the posterior mean of the previous level as an input.  
   - **Step 3**: Propagate uncertainty through Monte Carlo integration for predictions.  

**Key Innovation**: Avoids the intractability of deep GPs by using deterministic posterior means from previous levels, simplifying training to standard GP regression.

#### **3. Results**  
**Benchmark Problems**:  
1. **Pedagogical 1D Example**:  
   - **Low-fidelity**: \(f_l(x) = \sin(8\pi x)\).  
   - **High-fidelity**: \(f_h(x) = (x - \sqrt{2})f_l^2(x)\).  
   - **Result**: NARGP captures nonlinear cross-correlations (Figure 2a), outperforming AR1 (Figure 2b).  

2. **Branin Function (3-Level)**:  
   - **Low/medium/high-fidelity**: Complex transformations of the Branin function.  
   - **Result**: NARGP achieves \(\mathbb{L}_2\) error = 0.023 vs. AR1’s 0.112 (Figure 7).  

3. **Mixed Convection Flow**:  
   - Combines experimental correlations (low-fidelity) and Navier-Stokes simulations (high-fidelity).  
   - **Result**: NARGP reduces prediction error by leveraging nonlinear correlations, even in opposing flow regimes (Figure 10).  

**Key Insight**: NARGP outperforms linear autoregressive models in accuracy, especially in regions where low-fidelity data are sparse or misleading.

#### **4. Discussion & Conclusion**  
**Advantages of NARGP**:  
1. **Flexibility**: Captures nonlinear/space-dependent correlations without deep GP complexity.  
2. **Efficiency**: Maintains \(\mathcal{O}(n^3)\) training cost (same as AR1).  
3. **Robustness**: Safeguards against misleading low-fidelity trends.  

**Limitations**:  
- Assumes **noiseless data**; extensions to noisy data require semi-supervised GPs.  
- Nested experimental designs (\(D_t \subseteq D_{t-1}\)) may restrict flexibility.  

**Future Work**:  
- Integration with scalable GP approximations (e.g., sparse GPs).  
- Applications to high-dimensional/real-time systems.
